# Security Policy

## Supported versions

We maintain the `main` branch and the latest tagged release. If a critical issue affects a tagged release, we may patch the latest tag.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not** open public issues for security reports.

- Preferred: open a private **GitHub Security Advisory** (Security tab â†’ Report a vulnerability)

We will acknowledge reports within 72 hours and keep you informed of the fix progress.

## Disclosure

Once a fix is available, we will publish a brief advisory and credit reporters who wish to be acknowledged.
