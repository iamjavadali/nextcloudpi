# Instructions to run Collabora-Code server

git clone https://github.com/iamjavadali/solrstation.git

cd solrstation/docker-containers/collabora

# Edit the collabora-code.sh file

nano collabora-code.sh

# edit the following variables

domain=###.###.###.###:PORT	# Set this to the IP+Port pointing to the collabora/code server
server_name=your-domain.com	# Set this to the domain pointed to your collabora/code server
user=admin	# Change this username for the admin panel
pass=password	# Change this password for the admin panel
tz=America/New_York	# Change this for your local time zone

# Save and check if the file is executable

chmod +x collabora-code.sh

# Run the script

./collabora-code.sh

# In your nextcloud installation head over to administration settings -> Office
# Select "Use your own server"
# Enter URL (and Port) of collabora Online-server: example: use either domain or server_name values - https://office.solrstation.com or https://192.168.1.101:9980
# Allow list for WOPI requests: enter the following - 172.70.0.0/16, 162.158.0.0/16

# You can find the IP range of your WOPI host by entering 0.0.0.0 in your WOPI allow list and then opening up a document in nextcloud to get the WOPI denied error. Upon receiving this error, you can look at the logs in your administration settings for warnings on WOPI requests denied.
# Example: WOPI request denied from 172.70.111.138 as it does not match the configured ranges: 0.0.0.0
# Take the denied from IP and turn it into a range by keeping the first two values. example: 172.70
# Then enter .0.0/16 to the end of it. example: 172.70.0.0/16
# Try opening a document again, and you will get another WOPI denied error, this time showing you another IP range.
# example: WOPI request denied from 162.158.154.60 as it does not match the configured ranges: 172.70.0.0/16
# Add this IP as you did before to your WOPI allow list by keeping the first 2 parts of the IP and turning the remaining into a range: example: 162.158.0.0/16
# Combine both IP ranges together and add them into your WOPI allow list
example: 172.70.0.0/16, 162.158.0.0/16
# Open a document again in nextcloud. Now you should not have any WOPI errors, and the document should open without any further errors.
