Steps to replicate:

Clone Repo

#	git clone https://github.com/iamjavadali/solrstation.git

Enter docker-compose directory

#	cd solrstation/Docker/NginxProxyManager

Build Dockerfile

#	sudo docker compose build

Build + Run docker compose

#	sudo docker compose up -d


Port Info:

	nginx admin port: 81
	goaccess stats port: 7880
	mariadb port: 3306

After the Nginx Proxy Manager is running for the first time, the following will happen:

	GPG keys will be generated and saved in the data folder
	The database will initialize with table structures
	A default admin user will be created

This process can take a couple of minutes depending on your machine.

Default Administrator User

	Email:    admin@example.com
	Password: changeme

Immediately after logging in with this default user you will be asked to modify your details and change your password.
